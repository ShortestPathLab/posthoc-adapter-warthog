## About ##

In this repository you will find implementations of various algorithms I have studied as part of my doctoral research into path-finding. This includes Jump Point Search and Rectangular Symmetry Reduction.

My development platform is OSX 10.8.4 with most of the code here being written in C++. When compiling I recommend that platform together with GCC 4.8.1. In the past I have successfully compiled and executed the same code on Linux (most recently Ubuntu 13.10).
