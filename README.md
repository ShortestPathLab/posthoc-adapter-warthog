## About ##

In this repository you will find implementations of various algorithms I have studied as part of my doctoral research into path-finding. This includes Jump Point Search and Rectangular Symmetry Reduction.

If you would like more information about my work, or are looking for copies of published papers, please visit my [ANU homepage](http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~dharabor).

The code hosted here is written in C++. Much of it is built from the ground up. Some is built on top of Nathan Sturtevant's open-source pathfinding library [Hierarchical Open Graph](http://hog2.googlecode.com). All of it is made available under the terms of the GNU GPL Version 2. 

My development platform is OSX 10.8.4 with most of the code here being written in C++. When compiling I recommend that platform together with GCC 4.8.1. In the past I have successfully compiled and executed the same code on Linux (most recently Ubuntu 13.10). 

The current "release" is tagged [may2016](https://bitbucket.org/dharabor/pathfinding/commits/tag/may2016).

All code is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL Version 2. I make it available in the interest of scientific research and without any guarantees.
